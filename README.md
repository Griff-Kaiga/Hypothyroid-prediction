# Hypothyroid-prediction

Description

This analysis was performed on data provided Nairobi Hospistal on tests for hyperthyroidism for various patients.
Hyperthyroidism is the abnormal function of your thyroid gland, an organ located in the front of your neck that releases hormones to regulate your body’s use of energy. In other words, if your thyroid gland is overactive and makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs, it causes hyperthyroidism.

The hormones produced by your thyroid gland are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), and they play an important role in the way your entire body functions. For this reason, when they’re out-of-whack, it can have far-reaching effects on almost every aspect of your health.
